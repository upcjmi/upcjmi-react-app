                Jamia Millia Islamia made a modest beginning in 1920 at Aligarh, with the resolute
                determination of its founding members--Shaikhul Hind Maulana Mahmud Hasan, Maulana
                Muhammad Ali Jauhar, Jenab Hakim Ajmal Khan, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari, Jenab Abdul
                Majeed Khwaja, and Dr. Zakir Hussain to create an institution that would manifest
                indigenous ethos and spirit of plurality. It was conceived as a national institution
                that would offer progressive education and nationalist ideals to students from all
                communities, particularly the Muslims. The emergence of Jamia was supported by
                Gandhiji and Tagore who felt that Jamia could shape lives of hundreds and thousands
                of students on the basis of a shared culture and worldview. Jamiaâ€™s development is
                marked by sacrifices made by the staff and students and a host of individuals who
                contributed through myriad efforts.
